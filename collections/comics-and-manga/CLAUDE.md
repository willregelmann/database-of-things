# Comics & Manga — curation hints

## What belongs here

Periodical comics and manga — Western comics and manga live together here
because they're the same kind of collectible (a serialized publication
bought a part at a time) sold through the same shops, and a growing number
of publishers put out both.

The **primary collectible unit differs by tradition**, and that's a
per-series fact, not a directory-level one:

- **Western comics — the single issue.** Not collected editions (trade
  paperbacks, deluxe hardcovers, compendiums); those repackage issues that
  already exist as entities here, so they're a separate future concern
  rather than duplicate entities.
- **Manga — the tankōbon volume**, not the individual magazine chapter.
  Most manga serializes chapter by chapter in a magazine first, but those
  chapters generally aren't collected individually the way Western issues
  are. Not light novels or dōjinshi — those are a separate future concern
  rather than folded in here.

Use `type: issue` or `type: volume` on the entity accordingly. The
distinction is recorded in the data, not in directory position.

## Model the English-language edition

For anything published in Japanese first, **catalog the English-language
edition, not the original Japanese one** — same convention as Pokémon TCG
cataloging English/US card sets rather than their Japanese originals (see
[`trading-cards/pokemon-tcg/CLAUDE.md`](../trading-cards/pokemon-tcg/CLAUDE.md)).
Volume numbers, titles, and dates all follow the English release; note the
original Japanese publisher and serialization in the series'
`_collection.yaml` description for context, but don't create separate
entities for Japanese tankōbon.

If a series has never had an English release, that's a gap to flag rather
than a reason to catalog the Japanese edition instead — ask a maintainer
before deviating from this.

## Directory structure

```
comics-and-manga/
  CLAUDE.md
  template.schema.json          # generic fallback; each series overrides it
  _collection.yaml
  <publisher>/
    _collection.yaml
    <series>/
      CLAUDE.md                  # series-specific conventions — required
      template.schema.json       # series-specific attributes — required
      _collection.yaml
      <issue-or-volume>.yaml
```

**The top level under `comics-and-manga/` is always a publisher** — never a
genre, imprint-within-a-publisher, era, medium, or anything else. Publisher
is its own directory level (not folded into series) because series names
aren't guaranteed unique across publishers, and because a flat list of
series would blow past the ~100-nested-collections guideline in
[`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) long before the catalog is meaningfully
complete. Follow the shape of
[`image/monstress/CLAUDE.md`](image/monstress/CLAUDE.md) as a worked
example.

**For manga, the publisher is the English-language licensor** (VIZ Media,
Yen Press, Seven Seas, Kodansha USA, …) — consistent with modelling the
English edition, and the only publisher that's a stable property of the
edition being catalogued. The original Japanese publisher belongs in the
series' `_collection.yaml` description, not in the directory tree.

A license can move between English publishers over the life of a series (a
relicense, a new omnibus edition from someone else). **When that happens, each
publisher's edition is its own collection under that publisher, and a shared
`tags/franchises/` tag reunifies them.**

This is the same answer
[`../figures-and-models/CLAUDE.md`](../figures-and-models/CLAUDE.md) gives for
a franchise that changes *manufacturer* — Power Rangers splits into
`bandai/power-rangers/` and `hasbro/power-rangers/`, reunified by a
`power-rangers` tag. A publisher change over time is the same problem, so it
gets the same shape rather than a comics-specific rule.

It also follows from [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#collectibles-not-products):
editions differ in translation, format, trim and ISBN, so they're physically
distinct objects, and the catalog deduplicates on physical uniqueness. A
colorized US-format edition and an original-monochrome one are not the same
collectible.

**Akira is the worked example.** It has had three English publishers — Epic
Comics from 1988 (colorized, cut into US-format issues), Dark Horse from 2000
(oversized monochrome), Kodansha Comics since 2009. No "pick the edition being
catalogued" rule survives that: choosing one silently discards two real
editions, and the out-of-print one is often the more collected. Ghost in the
Shell splits the same way between Dark Horse (1995) and Kodansha (2009 on).

Two things this does *not* license:

- **A reprint or new printing by the same publisher isn't a new collection** —
  Dark Horse's own deluxe hardcover reissue of a series it already published
  belongs to that same collection.
- **Don't scaffold a publisher's edition you can't source.** An edition
  earns a directory when someone actually catalogues it, not because the
  series once passed through that publisher. The franchise tag is what keeps
  the parts findable in the meantime.

Say which edition a collection covers in its `description`, and in the series'
own `CLAUDE.md` once it has one.

## Adding a new series

A series arrives in **two phases — scaffold it first, author its conventions
when it actually has issues filed.** See
[`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#scaffolding-a-new-collection) for the rule and
why it works this way; the phases below are this family's version of it.

**Phase 1 — scaffold.** No new conventions needed; anyone (or any automated
curation pass) can do this.

1. Create `<publisher>/<series>/` (create `<publisher>/` too if it doesn't
   exist yet — it only needs a `_collection.yaml`, no `CLAUDE.md`/schema of
   its own unless it has series that need different conventions).
2. Write `_collection.yaml`. The series inherits this family's `CLAUDE.md`
   and `template.schema.json` for now — `dark-horse/hellboy/` has run that
   way since it was created.
3. Run the validator before opening a PR.

**Phase 2 — author its conventions.** Required before the first issue is
filed under the series.

4. Write the series' `CLAUDE.md` — numbering scheme (confirm whether it's
   continuous or resets, and check for spin-offs/miniseries with separate
   numbering before assuming a flat structure), identification approach,
   known pitfalls. For manga, also cover how the
   Japanese-publisher-vs-English-licensor distinction plays out for that
   series, including any relicense or omnibus re-release.
5. Write `template.schema.json` — don't reuse another series' attributes
   as-is; verify against the actual series (credits, format) rather than
   assuming they match.
6. Run the validator before opening a PR.

Comics is the family where phase 2 matters most — numbering resets, volume
restarts, and relicensed reprints differ so much series to series that an
inherited schema rarely survives contact with a real run for long.
